# SlackBot with GenAI for Expense Management

**Problem Statement:** Expense management is a critical aspect of financial operations within organizations, involving the submission, approval, and processing of expense reports. Traditional methods of managing expenses often rely on manual processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Employees typically submit physical or digital receipts, which are then manually reviewed and approved by managers. This process can lead to delays, inaccuracies, and a lack of real-time visibility into expense data.

**Objective:** 

1. Employees can use the Slack bot to submit their expenses directly through Slack, including details such as amount, category, and receipt images.
          
2. The bot prompts the employee to upload a receipt with details like expense amount, category (e.g., travel, meals).
   
3. The bot sends a notification to the employee's manager or the designated approver, asking them to review and approve the expense.
