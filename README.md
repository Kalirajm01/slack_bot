# SlackBot with GenAI for Expense Management

**Problem Statement:** Expense management is a critical aspect of financial operations within organizations, involving the submission, approval, and processing of expense reports. Traditional methods of managing expenses often rely on manual processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Employees typically submit physical or digital receipts, which are then manually reviewed and approved by managers. This process can lead to delays, inaccuracies, and a lack of real-time visibility into expense data.
